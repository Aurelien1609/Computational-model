# Computational-model

I study cognitive science at university of bordeaux and I work in the Mnemosyne Team at IMN (Institut of Neurodegenerative Diseases).

My work focuses on the development of computational model of the globus pallidus in the anesthesided mice.

In this repositories, I try to simulate two neuronal networks : striatal and pallidal neurons with DANA and Brian which are various ways of modeling neurons.
