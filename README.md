# Computational model


I study cognitive science at university of bordeaux and I work in the Mnemosyne Team at IMN (Institut of Neurodegenerative Diseases).

My work focuses on the development of computational model of the globus pallidus and the striatum in the anesthesided mice.

In this repositories, I try to simulate differents neuronal networks, based on Lapicque equation. We have built a spikes model and a frequency model. In additional, I developped sames models with neural fields theory. 

Code tested with :
Python 2.7.9
Numpy 1.9.1
Scipy 0.14.1
Brian 1.4.1
Dana 0.5.1
